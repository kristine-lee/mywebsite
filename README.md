Built with:

## In Process
- Currently in the process of converting CSS Modules to CSS-in-JS, utilizing Styled Components. 
-- Benefits of CSS-in-JS over CSS modules includes: out-of-box SASS support, dynamic styling with React props, and theming
- Expanding the Project section
- Styling to match final fleshed-out prototypes
